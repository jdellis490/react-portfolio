# React-Portfolio

## Description
A portfolio page built using React, JavaScript, and CSS that showcases info about me, my projects , how to contact me, and my resume. I built this app to practice my React skills and to figure out how React works, as it is a very popular frontend framework. This also helped me to further my skills in JS and CSS.
