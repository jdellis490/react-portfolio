        Hello, I'm Justin, a now Full Stack Software Engineer with a background in Occupational Therapy. 
        On my spare time, I am constantly working to improve my skills gained through continuing education on
        technologies and seeing how I can apply them to my everyday life. Ever since I learned programming, I
        developed a passion for it and try to make a daily habit. Technology never stops improving, whether
        it's through improved versions of technology or completely new technology and I am willing to learn in
        in the future and in the work place.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Programming is an amazing creative outlet that allows one to make anything they set their mind to. 
        Although challenging at times, when enough effort is placed, fulfillment occurs and all the hard work
        seems worth it. When I am not coding, I enjoy working out, video games, spending time with friends,
         and the occasional Netflix binge.
